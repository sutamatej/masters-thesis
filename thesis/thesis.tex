\chapter{Introduction}

As computers get more powerful and complex so does the software. However,
the increasing complexity of software leads to increased number of errors
found in it. There are many techniques that try to prevent software bugs,
e.g.~testing, formal verification, etc. Abstract interpretation is the approach
that is the subject of this thesis. 
Moreover, there are many aspects of the program one can focus on. One of them
is how program works with strings. A string is very flexible data structure
that allows programmer to represent practically anything. Most of the programs
written today deal with strings somehow. They may be used for program
input/output or to generate whole other programs (SQL). Thus, it's important
to know how program treats strings.

This thesis describes how abstract interpretation works and how string abstract
domains are related to it. It is based on texts from Cousot~\cite{CousotCousot77-1}
The goal of the thesis is to design and implement several abstract domains for
strings and integrate them into \texttt{canal} abstract interpreter, which is
a tool designed to analyze behavior of application programs written in
\texttt{C}.

The thesis has the following outline: chapter~\ref{chap:preliminaries} presents
preliminaries required to understand the abstract interpretation. In
chapter~\ref{chap:design} several string abstract domains are designed.
The implementation of designed domains is described in great detail in
chapter~\ref{chap:implementation}. Finally, thesis findings are summarized in
chapter~\ref{chap:conclusion}. Appendix~\ref{chap:instructions} contains
instructions for compiling and running the \texttt{canal} abstract interpreter.
