\chapter{Introduction}

Computers have followed Moore's~law~\cite{Moore65-1} for more than
four decades now. Hardware gets more powerful and complex. Consequently,
this results in software being more complex too. It has to be designed
with maintainability and reliability in mind. Therefore several software
verification methods have been created. Abstract interpretation is one
of them.

There are many aspects of a computer program that may be analyzed by
abstract interpretation. The focus of this thesis is
is how program manipulates strings. A string is very flexible data
structure that allows programmer to represent practically anything.
In fact, most of the programs written today have to deal with strings
in some form. Thus, it is important to know how programs treat strings.

This thesis describes string abstract domains in context of abstract
interpretation framework. It is based on papers published
by Cousot~\cite{CousotCousot77-1} and other authors. The goal of the thesis
is to design, implement and integrate several abstract domains for strings
into \texttt{canal} abstract interpreter. \texttt{canal} is a tool designed
to analyze behavior of application programs written in \texttt{C}.

The text has the following outline: chapter~\ref{chap:preliminaries}
presents preliminaries required to understand the abstract interpretation.
In chapter~\ref{chap:design} several string abstract domains are designed.
The implementation of designed domains is described in great detail in
chapter~\ref{chap:implementation}. Finally, thesis findings are summarized
in chapter~\ref{chap:conclusion}. Appendix~\ref{chap:instructions} contains
instructions for compiling and running the \texttt{canal} abstract
interpreter.


\chapter{Static analysis and abstract interpretation}
\label{chap:preliminaries}

Quality is important property of a product that is being created by
software engineers. Not every project needs to have as high quality as
safety critical systems but to a certain degree quality matters
everywhere. It is crucial for software maintainaility which becomes
especially difficult when size of a codebase and number of developers
increases. A static analysis is one of the means to achieve quality
despite these factors.


\section{Static analysis}

Static code analysis is a well known term in software industry but there
is no proper definition given anywhere. P.~Emanuelsson and U.~Nilsson
\cite{EmanuelssonNilsson08-1} refer to it as the analysis of a computer
program without actually executing it. This process is fully automatic
but a programmer needs to interpret the results of analysis and make
proper adjustments.

Most of the languages do not have a support for runtime error detection.
It is programmers responsibility to ensure these errors do not occur
and deal with them once they do. The errors do not include simple type
checking or syntax errors although even these could be considered a part
of static analysis. They are already checked by compiler. Hence, only
errors which lead to unexpected or undefined behavior are checked.
Consider the \texttt{C} code in listing~\ref{lst:outofbounds}:

\begin{lstlisting}[
    language=C,
    caption={Out of bounds array access},
    label=lst:outofbounds
]

    int array[3] = { 1, 2, 3 };
    int value = array[3];

\end{lstlisting}

In the example the \texttt{array} variable contains three integers but
\texttt{value} variable will contain unexpected value because it is accessing
the fourth element of the \texttt{array}. Moreover, the listing will compile
and run, but the number might be different every
time the program is run since accessing the items out of array bounds is
undefined behavior in \texttt{C} programming language. Other typical
examples of errors detected by static analysis are division by zero or.
Depending on the sophistication of implementation the static analysis
can be used for checking advanced properties of program run such as
buffer overflows or deadlocks.

The static analysis is primarily used to decrease the number of runtime
errors, even the ones that are normally impossible to check by testing.
However, it should not replace the testing completely. For example, the static
analysis can not verify that the program performs the correct function or
that it follows the rules defined by the problem that is being solved by
the program. Therefore these are ideally used in combination to ensure high
quality and reliability.
